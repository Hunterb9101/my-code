<h2>History:</h2>
<p> Programming has been around since the 1940's when computers were developed. The first code consisted of binary (1s and 0s). This first code was called machine code. machine code is a 
low-level programming language.High-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, threads, locks, and 
other abstract computer science concepts, with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency. Computers today run on machine code. But programmers don't program in that language anymore.
That is because it is extremely complex to understand what is being programmed in machine code. Here is a statement from the html code: </p>
<p class="demo"> &lsaquo;title&rsaquo; Programming &lsaquo;/title&rsaquo; </p>
<p> How many of you understood this statement above? For those of you who don't understand the &lsaquo;title&rsaquo; tag said that this is the title of the document. Then I put in the value that I 
wanted the title to be. In this case I wanted the title to be Programming. The HTML code requires an ending tag. That is why there is &lsaquo;/title&rsaquo;. Without this tag the computer doesn't 
know where to stop the value of the title.</p>
<h2>The languages the website uses</h2>
<p>This website uses <b>three</b> different high-level programming languages to get the desired effect. We used Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), Javascript, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
HTML is the basic building block of all websites. You can use it to visualize data through text, forms, images, and much more! It is a simple language is easy to learn.
I got good at it in about 5 months. Cascading Style Sheets are used for consistent colors across many pages. It makes it so you don't have to type as much style information when you make a new page and
used for global styles. Here is an example of CSS:</p>
<div class="CSSDemo"></div>
<p>
JavaScript is a scripting language for making the website dynamic. It can do something when you click a button, move the mouse or enter the site. It is a bit more complicated than that. Here is a 
simple statement from my code:
</p>
<p class="demo"> function bgcmagenta(){document.body.style.backgroundColor="magenta";}</p>
<p> This is a code from the JavaScript Styler I made. The name of this function is bgcmagenta(). This is the name it will be referenced as in an event. I can use the function when someone clicks an element like this: </p>
<p class="demo"> &lsaquo;button onclick="bgcmagenta()"&rsaquo; Turn the background color to magenta&lsaquo;/button&rsaquo; </p>
<p> Then the document changes the current background color to magenta.</p>
