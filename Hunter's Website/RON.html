<h1> Rise of Nations</h1>
<body id="RON">
<h3><b>1st topic: Population and Population Limit</b></h3>
<br>
<p>First of all I should talk about Population. Population is an amount of Civilians, Troops and Aircraft you have. Think of Population as a slot holder.  Most Troops, Civilians, Ships and Aircraft Cost 1 Population Slot…But some cost 2 Population like The Siege Units made in the Siege Factory, Battleships and 1 unit costs 7 population slots called an Aircraft Carrier made at the dock. Population Limit is the limit of population you can have in a game. All standard games start with 25 population as a limit. But you can increase this limit by: Military Research (Red) at the library, Obtaining Peacocks (A rare resource), and the Colossus Wonder (200 Wood and 200 Wealth with no wonders in nation)</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>2nd topic: Troops and Civilians</b></h3>
<br>
<p>Troops and Civilians are the playing pieces of the game. Civilians are the building blocks of any nation. They build buildings, gather resources and as a last resort defend a city (not a good idea, and has to be upgraded from the tower). Troops cannot do the same things as a citizen can but can attack 2 times to 20 times better. They can capture enemy towns and can’t have as much attrition damage when in enemy territory. There are multiple buildings where troops can be built: Barracks, Stable, Siege factory, Dock, Airbase and the Terra Cotta Army Wonder. Aircraft and Dock units cannot capture cities. Another civilian is the Caravan and the Merchant. Caravans travel between Allied and Neutral cities including yours!!! There is a caravan limit though. You can increase this amount by researching the Commerce line (Green). Merchants gather rare resources like salt, wine and peacocks.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>3rd topic: Researches</b></h3>
<br>
<p>Research is a very important part in the game. Every building except wonders and resource buildings do not have research. Library research is the most important researches in the game. There are 5 different research lines in the library. They are Age, Military, Civic, Commerce and Science. Age allows different resources, rare resources, troop research and buildings. Military research increases population and allows troop research (if you have the military research and age research on the same vertical line. Military can be farther than the age and it will work. Civic research increases the amount of cities you can have and increases national borders. Commerce increases commerce cap and allows 1 more caravan per research. Science decreases other research by 10% and increases ruin bonuses.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b> 4th topic: Buildings</b></h3>
<br>
<p>Buildings are the 2nd building block of a nation. Buildings can do various things like build troops, research researches, enhance resource buildings, gather resources and defend cities. Buildings do not cost population.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>5th topic: Nuclear Weapons</b></h3>
<br>
<p>Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapon in the game. They can be upgraded to Nuclear ICBM in the last age (Information Age).The limit to these warheads is the Armageddon Clock. When the clock reaches 0 everyone loses because of Armageddon. When fired nothing can stop them but missile shield. It is a future tech when you get all library researches done. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>6th topic: Airbases and Airplanes</b></h3>
<p>Airplanes and Airbases can be built in the 6th age (Industrial Age).The first aircraft you can purchase is a biplane. They are easy to shoot down with Radar Air Defense gun. Biplanes can only travel for a distance and then have to return to their former airbase. They refuel then can go the same distance as last time. To increase the amount of fuel they have upgrade to Fighter and Jet Fighter.  In the 7th age (Modern Age) you can have bombers. Bombers can’t attack Biplanes so they are vulnerable to aircraft attacks. They bombard buildings like siege units only more attack. Helicopters are also allowed in the Modern Age. They can attack aircraft and don’t ever have to refuel. But they are still vulnerable to Radar Air Defense Guns so watch out! The only way to counter aircraft is to build Anti-Aircraft Battery and Radar Air Defense Guns. Anti-Aircraft Batteries are built in the Siege Factory. RAD Guns are built by Citizens.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>7th topic: The 3 Domains</b></h3>
<br>
<p>The three domains are: Water, Air and Land. Land troops can’t go into water without 1 Science tech and a Dock. Land units can never go into air. Water troops cannot go onto land and only an aircraft carrier’s airplanes can go into air. Cruisers are allowed to fire into the air. Air troops sail across all 3 domains.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>8th topic: Resources</b></h3>
<br>
<p>There is no way to win without resources. Resources come from: Farms, Mines, Woodcutter’s Camp, Rare resources, Oil Platforms and Caravans. Most resources start with +10 income until a resource enhancer is in the city in which it is built. Oil is a resource that gives +35 income per each oil platform. Caravans give wealth by how big the cities are and how far away they are. Rare resources give +20 income of any resource (depends on the rare resource) until upgraded from the temple or the Porcelain Tower Wonder. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>9th topic: Commerce Cap</b></h3>
<br>
<p>Commerce cap limits the amount per 30 seconds you earn. You start with 70 as a commerce cap and increases up to 999 per each commerce research. Certain wonders allow higher commerce cap for a resource.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>10th topic: Wonders</b></h3>
<p>There are many wonders in this game: From the Great Pyramids of Egypt to Space Program in Cape Canaveral in the USA. Every Wonder gives you a very special ability. Like Colossus gives you 50 more population. But the catch is that each wonder can only be built once. So if it is destroyed by a Nuclear Weapon it is gone for the entire game. Statue of Liberty disables all attrition damage in the game plus all troop upgrades are free.</p>
